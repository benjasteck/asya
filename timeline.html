                <p>I may just laugh it off when you show concern for me. But know that deep down, i appreciate it immensely.
                I sometimes find myself not wanting to get out of bed, not do the homework or feeling too lazy to take proper care of myself.
                But knowing you're behind me, its almost as if you were here to give me a push in the right direction,
                    and then I get going because I want to be the best version of myself, and to make you the happiest girl on this planet.
                i love you so much baby<3 you push me towards a better future without even trying. A future I want to share with you.</p>

                because of how special and fantastic you are baby ;P. We've been together for 5 months at this point, and if ive learned anything from watching the relationship
                of others, it is that, that isn't normal. It's as if we were made for eachother, as if that's what god intended. It won't last forever because such is life, however
                when that time comes i don't doubt one bit that we will work through it together and come out stronger on the other side<3</p>
