    <h2>HAPPY BIRTHDAY BABEEE</h2>
    <p>To the love of my life, my greatest joy, and my best friend,
        <br>
        Today is not just any day—it’s your day, and that makes it the most special day of the year to me. Because today, the world was lucky enough to receive you—someone so incredibly kind, beautiful, and full of love that it’s almost hard to believe you're real.
        <br>
        From the moment you came into my life, you’ve made everything brighter. Your smile can light up the darkest days. You’ve shown me what it truly means to love and be loved, and I’m endlessly grateful for the way you love me back.
        <br>
        Every day I spend with you feels like a gift. Whether we’re having an adventure or just curled up on the couch rping, as long as I’m with you, I’m the happiest person alive. You inspire me to be better, not just for you, but for myself.
        <br>
        Today, I want to celebrate you, everything you are, everything you’ve accomplished, and everything you will be. You are more than enough, and I hope you see yourself through my eyes: as the most amazing, beautiful, and extraordinary person in the world.
        <br>
        Happy birthday, my love. I can’t wait to spend a lifetime celebrating you and showing you just how much you mean to me. Here’s to another year of love, laughter, and memories we’ll never forget. I love you more than words can say.</p>

    <h2>A love poem for you</h2>
    <p>In the quiet of the night, When stars above begin to glow,<br>
        I find my thoughts of you take flight, Like whispers only I could know.<br><br>
        
        Your laughter is the melody,
        That dances in the air I breathe,<br>
        A symphony so sweet and free,
        A gift that only you could weave.<br><br>
        
        Your eyes, a universe of light,
        With every glance, my heart does race,<br>
        A shining beacon in my night,
        Guiding me to your embrace.<br><br>
        
        Through every moment, small or grand,
        You paint my world with endless hues,<br>
        In every touch, in every hand,
        I find the love that always renews.<br><br>
        
        So here’s my heart, forever true,
        A piece of me, forever yours,<br>
        For every breath I take, I do,
        It’s you I cherish, love, and adore.
        </p>

<h2>Hey my love</h2>
<p>I know things feel heavy right now, and it's okay to feel like this sometimes. But I want you to remember that you're not alone, even when the world feels quiet and distant. I’m here, and we’ll face this together. You have so much light within you, and even on the hardest days, I see it shining through. Healing takes time, but every small step forward counts. I believe in you, and I’m proud of your strength, even when you can’t see it. 
    Let’s keep moving through this, one moment at a time. I love you so much, and I’m here for you always. I promise with all that is within me that if you fight with me. ill stick with u until the end.
    Youre so much more than you give yourself credit for and if u believe me please trust me when i say that theres nothing wrong with you. I promise</p>
